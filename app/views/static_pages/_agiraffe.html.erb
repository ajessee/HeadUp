                    The giraffe’s iconic feature is its long neck.  Symbolically, this long neck represents reaching out, stretching, and elevating ourselves.  Dream analysts believe that a giraffe in our dreams is a reminder that we are all powerful beings with remarkable potential to not only rise to a challenge, but do so with grace and integrity.

                <h2 class="white_text">The giraffe represents long-reaching, far-seeing vision.  With its head lifted as high as the treetops, the giraffe's vision is focused on the horizon. Giraffe’s literally see a "bigger picture."

                <h2 class="white_text">
                Of the Big Five megafauna of Africa, the giraffe is the only one with a steady temper and quiet demeanor.  It is confident in its power.  It doesn’t need to be aggressive or predatory to survive.
